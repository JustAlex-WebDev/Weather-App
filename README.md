# Weather-App

This application will be created with the help of React JS, Tailwind CSS and by using OpenWeatherMap API. The app will also include hourly and daily forecasts.

Technologies that will be used for this project are JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, luxon, unicons, and react-toastify. There will be fetching of data from OpenWeather endpoints, getting temperature, max, min, humidity, real feel, sunrise, sunset, hourly, and daily forecast. Also, the local time at the selected location will be displayed. For input, there are some quick links on top along with a text box for searching a city and also a current location-based search.
